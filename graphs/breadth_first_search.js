/*
    BFS visits the nodes one level at a time.
    To prevent visiting the same node more than once, weâ€™ll maintain a visited object.
    Since we need to process the nodes in a First In First Out fashion,
    a queue is a good contender for the data structure to use. The time complexity is O(V+E)
